<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.covid19mobility.org/">COVID-19 Mobility Data Network</a> our lab, along
with the <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/">Dan Larremore</a> at CU and 
<a href="https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bailey/">Bailey Fosdick</a> at CSU, is using mobility data from
<a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/">Facebook Data for
Good</a> to help state
and local governments monitor activey in their jurisdicitons while stay-at-home
orders are in place and as reopening begins.</p>

<p>We are currently working directly with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boulder County, CO</li>
  <li>Arapahoe County, CO</li>
  <li>Denver, CO</li>
  <li>Salt Lake County, UT</li>
  <li>University of Colorado, Boulder</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook provides aggregaed an annonmized user density data three times per day
for tiles that range in size from 2km to 0.6km squater.</p>

<p>From this data we have developed metrics that measure activity trends.  Some of
our metrics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A weekend score measures the differences between weekday and weekend activity.
Ideally, if people are staying home and not working, there should not be a
difference.</li>
</ul>

</center>
<ul>
  <li>A slip score, which measures the difference in activity between adjacent
weeks. This score should be near zero during a stay-at-home order.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A hot-spot score, which measures the difference between current activity and
activity during the first week of the stay-at-home order.</li>
</ul>
<center>

<p>We are also using models to decompose the data into seasonal (night/day, weekday/weekend) and trend values.</p>

<p>To help explore these data, we are developing an interactive browser using 
<a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">plotly dash</a>. Here is a quick demo of our data browser:</p>
