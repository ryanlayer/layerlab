The [2019 Rocky Mountain Genomics HackCon](https://hackathon.colorado.edu) had
a great line up, including: 

- Maria Nattestad (Google)
- Deanna Church (Inscripta)
- Sanjida Rangwala (NCBI)
- Danielle Szafir (Information Science, CU Boulder)
- Dan Larremore (BioFrontiers Institute and Computer Science, CU Boulder)


I was also fortunate enough to get a chance to talk about
[samplot](https://github.com/ryanlayer/samplot) and [SV-plaudit](https://github.com/jbelyeu/SV-plaudit).

Here is a recording of that talk:
